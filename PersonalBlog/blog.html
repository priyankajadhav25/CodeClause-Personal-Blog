                    <h2>How did you get to where you are today?</h2>
                    <p>Every once in a while I start chatting to a complete stranger and a connection comes out of nowhere. This happened to me a few weeks ago when I met a Canadian woman named Nancy at a local cafe. We bonded over a love for banana french toast drenched in syrup. The breakfast was good but the conversation was even better. It was one of those deep conversations about life made light by good humour and crumbs of french toast flinging off forks as we emphasized our points.</p>

                    <h2>Can Vectors Replace Loops in Python?</h2>
                    <p>Loops come to us naturally, we learn about Loops in almost all programming languages. So, by default, we start implementing loops whenever there is a repetitive operation. But when we work with a large number of iterations (millions/billions of rows), using loops is a crime. You might be stuck for hours, to later realize that it won’t work. This is where implementing Vectorisation in python becomes super crucial.</p>

                    <h2>Words of wisdom</h2>
                    <p>'Words of wisdom' is a phrase that means 'good advice'. An older relative, for example, may give some words of wisdom about how to live a long life. Or a friend may give you words of wisdom when going through a hard time. Even strangers can give words of wisdom through books, interviews, or other communications.</p>
